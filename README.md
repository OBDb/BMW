## About BMW

BMW (Bayerische Motoren Werke AG) is a German multinational manufacturer of luxury vehicles and motorcycles headquartered in Munich, Bavaria. Founded in 1916, the company has evolved from an aircraft engine manufacturer during World War I to become one of the world's leading premium automobile and motorcycle manufacturers.

## Generations

### Early Years (1916-1945)
BMW began as Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG (Bavarian Aircraft Works) in 1916, producing aircraft engines. After World War I, the company was forced to cease aircraft engine production under the Treaty of Versailles. This led to diversification into motorcycle production in 1923 with the R32, and eventually automobile manufacturing in 1928 when BMW acquired the Automobilwerk Eisenach. The company's first car was the BMW 3/15, based on the Austin 7.

### Post-War Renaissance (1945-1965)
Following World War II, BMW faced significant challenges with its factories damaged or dismantled. The company resumed motorcycle production in 1948 and returned to car manufacturing in 1952 with the BMW 501 luxury sedan. The 1950s marked a challenging period, with financial difficulties nearly leading to acquisition by Daimler-Benz. However, BMW survived through strategic investments from the Quandt family and the successful introduction of the BMW 700.

### Modern Era (1965-2000)
The introduction of the "New Class" sedans in the 1960s marked BMW's transformation into a manufacturer of sports sedans. This era saw the introduction of iconic models like the 2002 and the launch of the 3, 5, and 7 Series product lines that continue to define BMW's vehicle range. The company also established its reputation for inline-six engines and rear-wheel drive configurations.

### Contemporary Period (2000-present)
The 21st century has seen BMW expand into new segments including SUVs with the X-Series, electric vehicles with the i-Series, and hybrid technology. The company has maintained its focus on driving dynamics while embracing technological innovations including iDrive infotainment systems, advanced driver assistance features, and electrification across its product range. BMW continues to be a leader in premium automotive manufacturing with a strong presence in global markets.
